                An active stylus pen offers enhanced functionality over a finger or passive stylus, providing benefits
                like pressure sensitivity for varied line weights, palm rejection to prevent unintended touches, and
                greater precision for detailed tasks such as note-taking, illustrating, and digital art. These digital
                components allow for a more natural and expressive user experience, mimicking traditional pens and
                pencils on digital devices.

                <p data-i18n="s6">
                    Styluses are designed for touchscreens, with a fine tip that allows for more precise and accurate
                    input than fingers. This makes it easier to perform delicate operations on the laptop, such as
                    drawing, sketching, or writing with precision.

                    A stylus is a popular tool for note-taking and drawing on laptops.
                    When it comes to editing documents and annotating, the stylus is highly effective, providing precise
                    control whether reviewing PDFs, marking up presentations, or editing images.
