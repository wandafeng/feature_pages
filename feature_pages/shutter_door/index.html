                Your privacy, protected with confidence at all times. The integrated camera shutter lets you physically
                cover the lens whenever you are not using it, ensuring complete control over your personal space. To
                give you added assurance, an on-screen notification instantly appears the moment the shutter is closed,
                clearly reminding you that the camera is safely blocked. With this thoughtful design, you can enjoy
                greater clarity, peace of mind, and freedom in every moment of use.
